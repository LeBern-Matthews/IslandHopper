# IslandHopper
Transportation app for the Caribbean

IslandHopper will be an inter- and intra-island transport hub, allowing users to check ferry and flight schedules, book tickets, and get real-time travel updates. It could be extended to accommodate weather-related delays or changes in transport schedules.
